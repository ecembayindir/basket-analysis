<h1 align="center">Market Basket Analysis</h1>

<br/>

<h2>🚀 <strong>Project Overview</strong></h2>
<p>
This project explores Market Basket Analysis using the Instacart dataset to understand the relationships between products customers purchase together. By identifying patterns in customer purchases, we can drive strategic decisions for product placement, inventory management, and targeted campaigns. Leveraging <strong>Python</strong>, <strong>Pandas</strong>, <strong>MLXtend</strong>, and <strong>Scikit-learn</strong>, the project showcases how data can be transformed into actionable insights to enhance business outcomes.

<h2>📈 <strong>Project Workflow</strong></h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Data Exploration and Cleaning</strong>: Analyzed and cleaned over 3.4 million orders and 32.4 million product entries to ensure consistency and quality.</li>
  <li><strong>Frequent Itemset Mining</strong>: Utilized Apriori, FP-Growth, and H-Mine algorithms to identify frequent itemsets and association rules with metrics like support, confidence, and lift.</li>
  <li><strong>Recommendation System</strong>: Developed a product recommendation system based on association rules, leveraging lift and confidence to suggest items customers are likely to buy together.</li>
  <li><strong>Insights Visualization</strong>: Summarized findings and visualized results to provide actionable insights for stakeholders.
</li>
</ul>

<h2>🔍 <strong>Methods Applied</strong></h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Apriori Algorithm:</strong> Used for frequent itemset mining to discover strong product associations.</li>
  <li><strong>FP-Growth Algorithm:</strong> Employed for efficient pattern discovery in large datasets.</li>
  <li><strong>H-Mine Algorithm:</strong> Utilized for hash-based mining to enhance memory efficiency during analysis.</li>
  <li><strong>Association Rule Mining:</strong> Generated rules based on metrics such as lift, confidence, and leverage.</li>
  <li><strong>Confidence Interval Analysis:</strong> Applied to filter significant products and reduce noise in the data.</li>
</ul>
